## Python Indentation

Where in other programming languages the indentation in code is for readability only, the indentation in Python is very important.

Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.

## Variable

In Python, variables are created when you assign a value to it

## Casting

You can specify the data type of a variable

```py
str()
int()
float()
```

## Get the type

```py
x = 5
print(type(x))
```

## Global Keyword
To create a global variable inside function
```py
def myFunc()
  global x
```

## Data Built in Types

Text Type:	str
Numeric Types:	int, float, complex
Sequence Types:	list, tuple, range
